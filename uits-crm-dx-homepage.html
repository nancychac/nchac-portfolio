    <section class="background-info">
      <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p>
          The UITS CRM & DX team was recently merged into one team. The team
          doesn't have an official page site on the umassp site. The team would
          like to have a homepage that includes an intro to the team and all of
          the resources for support.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- PROCESS -->
    <h2>PROCESS</h2>

    <section class="process">
      <div>
        <h3>ORIGINAL STATE</h3>
        <p>
          The organization site included pages for the digital experience (DX)
          team. The CRM team is new and merged with DX. It only included a page
          summarizing the team's roles and lacked support and resources they can
          provide.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>PEER RESEARCH</h3>
        <p>
          Used other university websites as references for creating the customer
          relationship management (CRM) page. I looked to see what elements we
          can incorporate into the site using Drupal.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>CONTENT PLANNING</h3>
        <p>
          A content checklist and guideline document was created. The team
          intended the team site to be a hub for users to find information on
          web content, accessibility, CRM, automation, and support. The assigned
          webpage designers created their wireframes for the site. This helped
          the team brainstorm and curate what the team needs and recognize what
          can be implemented based on accessibility guidelines and Drupal.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>IMPLEMENTATION</h3>
        <p>
          The team implemented the web content and design into the staging
          environment. Revisions were made to the guidelines as the team updated
          the pages in staging.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- CONTENT & DESIGN -->
    <section class="content-design">
      <h2>CONTENT & DESIGN</h2>
      <div class="wireframe">
        <img
          src="project-images/Nancy Wireframe of DX & CRM page.png"
          alt="Image of a wireframe of the landing pages of the new CRM and DX tame site."
          width="50%"
        />
      </div>

      <div class="wireframe-details">
        <ul>
          <li>
            The content of the wireframe was from the guideline document. I
            considered what the team could do using Drupal and tried to push the
            limitations of other designs we could utilize.
          </li>
          <li>
            I added graphics and icons to lists to further stylize the page and
            visualize the listed items for users.
          </li>
          <li>
            Support Page: The team decided to have a potential right sidebar,
            including a button linked to create cases for the IT help desk and
            DX & CRM support information. I created two options for the teams on
            the Support page with or without the right sidebar.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>
    <!-- CURRENT STATE -->
    <section class="current-state">
      <h2>CURRENT STATE</h2>
      <p>
        The elements from the home and support page are implemented to
        production. The team is currently working on creating the product page.
        This became a separate project as it involves further research on users'
        needs for learning and using products the organization licensed for
        employees.

    <!-- TAKEAWAYS -->
    <section class="takeaways">
      <h2>TAKEAWAYS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I learned that there are limitations to design when working with
          certain programs and applications such as Drupal. However, always aim
          to test those limitations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Accessibility is vital to user experience. Also coming up with the
          most optimal design solutions that will make development easier.
        </li>
        <li>
          This project helped me set the foundations of being a UX/UI designer
          and web developer.
