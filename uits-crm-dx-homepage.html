    <!-- BACKGROUND-->
    <section class="background">
      <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p>
          The University Information Technology Services (UITS) CRM & Digital Experience (DX) team was recently merged, 
          but the UMass President’s Office site had outdated content about the team. 
          We updated the web content and pages for CRM & DX to be under one landing page. 
          Sources for employees creating digital content 
          (i.e., emails, documents, social media) and accessibility guidelines were also added.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- PROCESS -->

    <section class="process">
      <h2>PROJECT PROCESS</h2>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>ORIGNAL STATE</li>
        <p>
          The organization site included pages for the digital experience (DX) 
          team as the CRM side of the team is new. 
          The UMPO site only included a page summarizing the team's roles and 
          lacked resources and training that were available to employees. 
          The web content was also outdated and provided inaccurate information about the team. 

        </p>
        <li>PEER RESEARCH</li>
        <p>
          Starting my design research, I looked into how other universities 
          formatted certain pages such as CRM. 
          I selected university IT pages that were made with Drupal as my 
          references and noted different ideas we could incorporate into the new team site.
          Some of the sections in the wireframe were inspired by my research. 
        </p>
        <li>CONTENT PLANNING & DESIGN</li>
        <p>
            The DX team created a content checklist and guideline document. 
           intend the website to be a hub for employees to find information on web content, 
           accessibility, CRM, automation, and support. 
           The content was revised as we moved into adding the content to 
           the web staging environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          I went through a few iterations of the wireframes based on the team's feedback. 
          In my initial wireframe, I prioritized the look and feel of the website. 
          As I received feedback from my team, I realized there needs to be a balance between the page designs and 
          how the end-users will respond. 
          When revising, I considered what looks and feels the best for our colleagues viewing the site. 
          Important questions that asked myself were "How can my designs help as many users as possible?" 
          and "How can I match my ideas to what can be developed on Drupal?"
        </p>

        <li>IMPLEMENTATION</li>
        <p>
          Each member was responsible for updating specific pages in the Drupal 
          staging environment. I developed the Home and Support pages in the staging 
          environment. We implemented the content into staging before adding it to 
          production for additional feedback.
        </p>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <!-- WIREFRAME -->    
    <section class="wireframe">
      <h2>WIREFRAME</h2>   
      <div class="wireframe-details">
        <ul>
          <li>
            The wireframe was created using Lucidchart from the Lucid Visual Collaboration Suite. I
            considered what the team could do using Drupal and tried to push the
            limitations of other designs we could utilize.
          </li>
          <li>
            Before, the Digital Experience site page was mostly text and lacked 
            structure. In the wireframe, I added more graphics besides the team 
            description at the top to lists to further stylize the page. 
            And I added icons to visualize list items for employees viewing the site. 
          </li>
          <li>
            On the support page, the team discussed having a potential right sidebar. 
            It would include having a button linked to create cases for the IT help desk and DX
            & CRM support information. I created two options for what the page would look 
            like with or without the right sidebar. 
            The team agreed to have the sidebar in the final version.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
        <img class="wireframe-image glightbox"
          src="wireframes/team-site-wireframe.png"
          alt="Image of a wireframe of the landing pages of the new CRM and DX team site."
        />
    </section>

    <!-- OUTCOME -->
    <section class="outcome">
      <h2>OUTCOME</h2>
      <p>
        The team site went live a few months ago. 
        In production, we left out the graphic images at the top of the page in the initial 
        wireframe to keep the page design clean and more accessible. 
        Images were instead utilized in the graphic cards linked to important pages. The digital content and accessibility sources 
        were prioritized during implementation. 
        The team will continue to update the site when necessary to share new content.
      </p>
    </section>

        <!--REFLECTION-->
        <section class="reflection">
          <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
          <p>
            This was my first UX and UI design project. 
            It helped me set the foundations of being a UX/UI designer and web developer. 
            The main takeaway was that I learned that there are limitations to design when 
            working with content management systems such as Drupal. 
            However, it’s always good to experiment with different design elements to innovate.
             Some of my designs didn’t make it to production but that 
             doesn’t negatively claim the quality of my work. 
             It is a part of the learning journey. Not all ideas make it to the final stages 
             of a product, but it is great to start with many to explore various options.
              I also learned that accessibility is vital to user experience. 
             This is an area of user experience that I overlooked at the beginning. 
             I will continue to learn and apply best design practices to future projects.
