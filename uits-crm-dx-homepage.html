    <!-- BACKGROUND-->
    <section class="background">
      <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p>
          The UITS CRM & Digital Experience (DX) team was recently merged together. 
          However, the team doesn't have an official page on the UMass President’s Office site. 
          The project team consisted the Digital Experience side of the team. 
          We updated the web content and pages for CRM & DX. 
          Also, added sources for users who need support in web content and digital accessibility.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- PROCESS -->

    <section class="process">
      <h2>PROJECT PROCESS</h2>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>ORIGNAL STATE</li>
        <p>
          The organization site included pages for the digital experience (DX) 
          team as the CRM side of the team is new. 
          The UMPO site only included a page summarizing the team's roles and 
          lacked resources and training that are available to users. 
          The web content was also outdated and provided inaccurate information. 

        </p>
        <li>PEER RESEARCH</li>
        <p>
          In my design research, I looked into how other universities 
          formatted certain pages such as CRM. 
          I selected university IT pages that were made with Drupal as my 
          references and noted different ideas we can incorporate into the new team site.

        </p>
        <li>CONTENT PLANNING & DESIGN</li>
        <p>
          The DX team created a content checklist and guideline document. 
           intend the website to be a hub for users to find information on web content, 
           accessibility, CRM, automation, and support. 
           The content was revised as we moved into adding the content into 
           the web staging environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          I developed a wireframe of the site according to the checklist and guidelines. 
          Feedback was exchanged among the team. 
          Please refer to the wireframe below for more details of my design process.
        </p>

        <li>IMPLEMENTATION</li>
        <p>
          Each member was responsible for updating specific pages in the Drupal 
          staging environment. I developed the Home and Support pages in the staging 
          environment. We implemented the content into staging before adding it to 
          production for additional feedback.
        </p>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <!-- WIREFRAME -->    
    <section class="wireframe">
      <h2>WIREFRAME</h2>   
      <div class="wireframe-details">
        <ul>
          <li>
            The content of the wireframe was from the guideline document. I
            considered what the team could do using Drupal and tried to push the
            limitations of other designs we could utilize.
          </li>
          <li>
            Before, the Digital Experience site page was mostly text and lacked 
            structure. In the wireframe, I added more graphics besides the team 
            description at the top to lists to further stylize the page. 
            And I added icons to listed items visualize it for users. 
          </li>
          <li>
            On the support page, the team discussed about to having a potential right sidebar. 
            It would include having a button linked to create cases for the IT help desk and DX
            & CRM support information. I created two options of what the page would look 
            like with or without the right sidebar. 
            The team agreed to have the sidebar in the final version.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
        <img class="wireframe-image glightbox"
          src="wireframes/team-site-wireframe.png"
          alt="Image of a wireframe of the landing pages of the new CRM and DX team site."

    <!-- OUTCOME -->
    <section class="outcome">
      <h2>OUTCOME</h2>
      <p>
        Everything is in production. 
        We left out the graphic images at the top of the page in the initial 
        wireframe to keep the page design clean and to make the pages for accessible. 
        Instead, graphic images were utilized in linked cards. Digital content and accessibility sources 
        were a priority during implementation. 
        The team continues to update the website when necessary.
      </p>

        <!--REFLECTION-->
        <section class="reflection">
          <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
          <p>
            This was my first UX/UI project. 
            It helped me set the foundations of being a UX/UI designer and web developer. 
            The main takeaway was that I learned that there are limitations to design when 
            working with content management systems as Drupal. 
            However, it’s always good to experiment with different design elements to innovate.
             Some of my designs didn’t make it to production but that 
             doesn’t negatviely impact me as a designer. 
             It is apart of the learning journey and not all ideas make it to the final stages 
             of a product.  I also learned that accessibility is vital to user experience. 
             This is an area of user experience that I easily overlooked in the beginning. 
             I will continue to learn and apply best accessibility practices to future projects.
