 <!-- PROJECT INFO -->
 <h2> PROJECT INFO </h2>
 <ul>
   <li> Tools: Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, FreePik </li>
   <li> Role: Graphic Designer </li>
   <li> Project Type: Work </li>
   <li> Timeline: January to April 2024 </li>
 </ul>
 
 <!-- BACKGROUND -->
 <p> ERP Summit is a joint event hosted by UMass and Deloitte. This was an opportunity to initiate discussions and learn more about how UMass can improve enterprise resource planning (ERP).
    My role was to design an event logo and web banner. This was also printed on free merchandise given to the attendees.
</p>
 
 <!-- PROJECT CONTENT -->
 <h2> OBJECTIVE </h2>
 <p> ERP Summit was an event for initial discussions on upgrading UMass' ERP system. To exchange ideas and opinions with Deloitte for consultation. A logo was needed to demonstrate the mission of “Learn, Think, Share” </p>
 
 <h2> PLANNING & DESIGN </h2>
<ul> 
    <li> The team came up with different mockups of logos to potentially use. Here are the mockups I created. </li>
    <li> The team decided to the current version which is one of the samples I designed on Adobe Illustrator. Each icon represents how ERP helps the university. I also included the system's brand colors.
    </li>
    <li> A website was created for attendees and viewers to stay engaged. I also designed the web banner which includes the square graphic and icons from the logos.
    </li>
    <li> I worked together with the event coordinators to print the logos on stickers, pens, and notebooks. </li>
    <li> A problem that occurred was printing the pens. The printers had to accommodate only using the university logo and slogan due to the square graphic being too small for the pen. The colors also had to be changed so the graphics and text could be properly printed.
    </li>
</ul>

 <!-- OUTCOME -->
 <h2> OUTCOME </h2>
 <p> The event was a success. There was positve feedback on the logo and it demonstrated what the event is about. In the process, I had to create multiple iterations of the logo due to scalability issues when printing the merchandise. </p>
