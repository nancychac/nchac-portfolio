      <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p>
          ERP Summit is a joint event hosted by UMass and Deloitte. 
          This was an opportunity to initiate discussions and learn more 
          about how UMass can improve enterprise resource planning (ERP). 
          My role was to design an event logo and web banner. 
          This was also printed on free merchandise given to the attendees.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was an event for initial discussions on upgrading UMass' 
          ERP system. To exchange ideas and opinions with Deloitte for 
          consultation. A logo was needed to demonstrate the mission of 
          “Learn, Think, Share” 
        </p>

    <h2> PLANNING & DESIGN </h2>
    <p> The team came up with different mockups of logos to potentially use.
       Here are the mockups I created. The team decided to the current version which is one of the samples I designed on Adobe Illustrator. Each icon represents how ERP helps the university. I also included the system's brand colors.
      </p>
      <img class="image-design glightbox" src="erp-summit/Next Gen ERP Logo FINAL (White Background)-500px.png" 
      alt="An image of the ERP Summit Logo. 
      It includes a square split into four sections. 
      In the first row, the left blue square is a white graphic of a bar line chart. 
      The right red top square is a white icon of a stack of coins. On the bottom row, the left square is red with a white profile icon. 
      The bottom right square is blue with a white scholar icon. 
      On the right side of the square is the university logo on top, 
      UMass ERP Summit below, the slogan 'learn, think, share' under, and the event date 'April 24th, 2024'at the bottom." width="60%">
   
    <p> A website was created for attendees and viewers to stay engaged. 
      I also designed the web banner which includes the square graphic and icons from the logos.</p>
      <img class="image-design glightbox" src="erp-summit/ERP Summit Web Banner Draft 2.png" 
      alt="An image of the ERP Summit website banner. 
      There are 5 columns for each of the icons represented in the logo and UMass. 
      From left to right, the first has a white bar and line 
      graph white with a blue background. 
      The second has a white graphic image of a pile of
      stacked coins with a maroon background. 
      The third column has the UMass logo and a blue background. The fourth has a white icon of a person's 
      front profile and the background is maroon. 
      The fifth has a white scholar hat with blue as the background." 
      width="60%">  
    <p>I worked together with the event coordinators to print the logos on stickers, pens, and notebooks.

          <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
          <p>
            The main takeaway was to make sure that my graphics are easily scalable so they can adapt to various media. 
            A problem that occurred was printing the pens. 
            The printers had to accommodate only using the university logo 
            and slogan due to the square graphic being too small for the pen. 
            The colors also had to be changed so the graphics and text could be 
            properly printed.
