    <!--- BACKGROUND -->
    <section class="background">
      <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
      <p>
        The UMass President’s Office University Information Technology Services
        (UITS) has a product catalog page on the organization's website. This is
        the hub for employees to find product information that is licensed
        within UMass. This includes a landing page including cards of the listed
        products and individual pages. The team modified the web pages to make it
        accessible and up-to-date for employees.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!--- PROJECT PROCESS-->
    <section class="process">
      <h2>PROJECT PROCESS</h2>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>ORIGNAL STATE</li>
        <p>
          The product catalog has not been updated within a few years. It
          included products that are no longer licensed. There is also a group
          of new products that had to be added to the catalog. The individual
          article pages were also outdated and not accessible-friendly such as
          including broken URL links.
        </p>
        <li>CONTENT PLANNING & DESIGN</li>
        <p>
          The cards on the landing page were redesigned to be more accessible.
          The general format of the product pages was also redesigned. From top
          to bottom, it now includes the description and a login button to the
          product, Key Features, Eligibility, a Step-by-Step guide on How to
          Access the product, Related Knowledge Articles, and Resources from the
          Product site, and Related Products from the catalog. The team added
          preliminary content and reformatted the product catalog website in the
          Drupal staging environment. Each member had their own set of pages to
          update.
        </p>
        <li>INTERVIEW & TESTING</li>
        <p>
          I interviewed the Subject Matter Experts of the products to
          receive feedback on the new page designs. This retained their
          opinions on the new page format and auditing product information. 
          For the user testing, three colleagues were selected based on
          their experience with the product catalog. There were tasked-based
          questions instructing the users to find the product, its page, and
          related knowledge articles. The screen size adjustment (zooming-in) was
          also included.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall questions were asked about their user experience such as how
          they felt about the webpage layout, how often they use the product
          catalog, what they most like, and improvements for the
          site. Two users previously used the product catalog while one
          barely did before the test. Overall, they were able to complete the task-based
          questions, one important part is the search bar added to the landing
          page was the most helpful for all. There were also positive responses
          to the new layout and two users easily adapted to it. They critiqued
          specific products from UMass that should be further promoted on the
          product catalog page. There were also questions on specific wordings of
          section titles and labels which confused them.
        </p>

        <li>IMPLEMENTATION</li>
        <p>
          The team applied the feedback from the Subject Matter Experts and users to the staging
          page sites. After one final review, the team added these
          changes to the production site.
        </p>

    <!--- OUTCOME -->
    <section class="outcome">
      <h2>OUTCOME</h2>
      <p>
        The UITS Product Catalog is now up-to-date and accessible to more employees. The
        team will continue to update the website when new content is necessary. 
      </p>

    <!--REFLECTION-->
    <section class="reflection">
      <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
      <p>
        This was my first experience of being a user experience researcher. I
        learned the best practices of user testing such as the procedure to
        conduct it and what questions to ask. I also further understood my colleagues'
        different needs and wants for the product catalog. This
        experience made me consider the end-user’s perspective which can be
        easily overlooked during the design and development stages.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was my introduction to web development. 
        It was also my first time using Drupal. It provided a good opportunity
        to familiarize how UMass creates web content for the organization. I also learned
        the process of web development, from creating prototypes on the staging environment to going live in production.
