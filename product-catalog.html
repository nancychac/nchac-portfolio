      <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
      <p>
        The UMass President’s Office University Information Technology Services
        (UITS) has a product catalog page on the organization's website. This is
        the hub for employees to find product information that are licensed
        within UMass. This includes a landing page including cards of the listed
        products and individual pages. The team modified the webpages to make it
        accessible and up to date for users.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!--- PROJECT PROCESS-->
    <section class="process">
      <h2>PROJECT PROCESS</h2>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>ORIGNAL STATE</li>
        <p>
          The product catalog has not been updated within a few years. It
          included products that are no longer licensed. There are also a group
          of new products that need to be added to the catalog. The individual
          article pages were also outdated and not accessible-friendly such as
          including broken URL links.
        </p>
        <li>CONTENT PLANNING & DESIGN</li>
        <p>
          The cards on the landing page were redesigned to be more accessible.
          The general format of the product pages was also redesigned. From top
          to bottom, it now includes the description and a log in button to the
          product, Key Features, Eligibility, a Step-by-Step guide on How to
          Access the product, Related Knowledge Articles, Resources from the
          Product site, and Related Products from the catalog. The team added
          preliminary content and reformatted the product catalog website in the
          Drupal staging environment. Each member had their own set of pages to
          update.
        </p>
        <li>INTERVIEW & TESTING</li>
        <p>
          I interviewed with the Subject Matter Experts (SME) of the products to
          receive feedback on the new page designs. This retained to their
          opinions on the new page format and the content describing the
          product. For the user testing, three colleagues were selected based on
          their experience with the product catalog. There was tasked based
          questions instructing the users to find the product, its page, and
          related knowledge articles. The screen size adjustment (zoom-in) was
          also included.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall questions were asked about their user experience such as how
          they felt about the webpage layout, how often they use the product
          catalog, what did they most like and what needs improvement on the
          site. Two of the users frequently use the product catalog while one
          barely uses it. Overall, they were able to complete the task based
          questions, one important part is the search bar added in the landing
          page was the most helpful for all. There was also positive responses
          on the new layout and two users easily adapted to it. They critiqued
          about specific products from UMass that should be pushed to the
          product catalog. There were also questions on specific wordings of
          section titles and labels which confused them.
        </p>

        <li>IMPLEMENTATION</li>
        <p>
          The team applied the feedback from the SME’s and users to the staging
          page sites. After another round of review, the team added these
          changes to production.

    <!--- OUTCOME -->
    <section class="outcome">
      <h2>OUTCOME</h2>
      <p>
        The UITS Product Catalog is up to date and accessibility-friendly. The
        team will continue to update the website when necessary.
      </p>

    <section class="reflection">
      <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
      <p>
        This was my first experience of being a user experience researcher. I
        learned the best practices of user testing such as the procedure to
        conduct it and what questions to ask. Also further understanding the
        different needs and wants from Subject Matter Experts and users. This
        experience made me consider the end-user’s perspective which can be
        easily overlooked as a developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was also my first time using Drupal. It provided a good opportunity
        to familiarize how UMass creates their websites using it. Also going
        over the process of creating websites in staging then publishing in
        production. This was my introduction to web development.
