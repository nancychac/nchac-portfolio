    <!-- BACKGROUND-->
    <section class="background">
      <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p>
          This branched from another project involving updating the content of the 
          University Information Technology Services (UITS) knowledge base 
          articles in the UMass President’s Office site. 
          The current knowledge base site only has a search engine for users 
          to look at specific articles/ sources. My team is looking to refresh 
          and organize the web page. The final website will be accessible and 
          updated with relevant content.
        </p>
    </section>
 
 <!-- PROCESS -->  
 <section class="process">
  <h2>PROJECT PROCESS</h2>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>ORIGNAL STATE</li>
    <p>
      The webpage includes a search bar and a list of published 
      knowledge-base articles starting from the most recent. 
      It is run by Coveo. There are no UI elements used besides the website 
      header and the top menu options:  Support Home Page, Knowledge Articles, 
      View Your Cases, Create Case. The UMass President's Office knowledge base site is run by 
      Salesforce.
    </p>

    <li>PEER RESEARCH</li>
    <p>
    My design references were knowledge base pages from other universities. 
    The team also provided ideas from other organizations that utilized UI elements 
    such as icons and containers on their Help and FAQ pages. 
    From my references, I noted potential elements we can use from the examples to 
    the page design.
    </p>
    <li>CONTENT PLANNING & DESIGN</li>
    <p>
      In our initial discussion about the knowledge articles, 
      we received feedback from knowledge base article content owners about 
      the webpage layout. They recommended adding the article creation date,
       related articles, responsible department/team on the article pages. 
       For the homepage, the team agreed to have containers of general 
       categories (i.e., “around the office”, onboarding, specific products) 
       of articles in the knowledge base. Refer to the wireframe below for 
       more details of my design process.
    </p>

    <p>
      We researched potential widgets and elements used on Salesforce 
      CRM marketplace that could be used based on my wireframe design. 
      This is to know what our options are for development. 
      I also interviewed the article content owners to audit knowledge articles and discussed 
        what content needs to be added to Salesforce Knowledge. 
      There were also questions about updating the article periodically and 
      sending automated reminders to them. Implementation is still pending 
      and will be the next step.
    </p>
  </ol>

 <!-- CONTENT & DESIGN -->
 <section class="wireframe">
  <h2>WIREFRAME</h2>   
  <div class="wireframe-details">
    <ul>
      <li>
        This wireframe was created using Lucidchart from the Lucid Visual Collaboration Suite.
        The landing, category, and article pages are navigated from left to 
        right. The design choices are based on interviewed user preferences 
        and research references.
      </li>
      <li>
        On the landing page, I kept the search bar and added a directory of 
        categories most of the articles might relate to. These are organized 
        as cards that users can click on to go to the category 
        pages. The right sidebar includes cards of the most recent and 
        popular articles. The third bottom card includes a list of 
        article topic tags.

      </li>
      <li>
        The category page includes groups of articles retaining 
        frequently asked questions. On top of the section are buttons users 
        can click to jump to a specific section. The right sidebar includes 
        a search bar on the right and the same containers as the landing 
        page. The difference is it includes a list relating to the specific 
        category.
      </li>
      <li>
        The article page continues the content. 
        The details container includes the dates of when it was last 
        modified and created. It also has a responsible team/department. 
        I also added a list of related articles and links to sources outside 
        of the knowledge base.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
    <img class="wireframe-image glightbox"
      src="wireframes/UITS-Knowledge-Base-UI-Wireframe.png"
      alt="Image of a wireframe of the proprosed site design 
      pages of the updated Knowledge Base website. 
      It includes the landing page, a article category page 
      that's linked in the article category boxes from the landing page. 
      The article category page includes FAQ questions and 
      related articles of specific topics clicked from the landing page. 
      The clicking on the related articles lead to the article page."

       <!--- LIGHTBOX SCRIPT -->
   <script>
    // This line is required to call the lightbox for the page.
    var lightbox = GLightbox();
  
    // Optional code just to see if it worked.
    lightbox.on('open', (target) => {
        console.log('lightbox opened');
    });

     <!-- OUTCOME -->
     <section class="outcome">
      <h2>OUTCOME</h2>
      <p>
        This project is still ongoing and content planning is still underway. 
        We’re working towards updating the web content on Salesforce.
      </p>
    </section>

        <!--REFLECTION-->
        <section class="reflection">
          <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
            <p>
              This project provided the opportunity to do user interface design as well 
              as interview users for our knowledge base. So far, I understand that each user has different preferences
              for product features. From my previous project on the CRM & DX Site refresh, 
              I applied my takeaways in UX design to the 
              project. This includes practicing creating low-fidelity wireframes, graphic placements, 
              and what would be most useful for users on specific pages.
            </p>

            <p>
              Going into Salesforce Knowledge and updating the content will 
              be the next step. I expect this to be a learning curve since 
              this will be my first hands-on experience using Salesforce Knowledge for 
              web development. However, this will be an excellent opportunity 
              to expand my skill set.
