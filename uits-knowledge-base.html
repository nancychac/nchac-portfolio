 <!-- PROJECT INFO -->
 <h2> PROJECT INFO </h2>
 <ul>
   <li> Timeline: March 2024 - July 2024 </li>
   <li> Team: Digital Experience (DX) Team </li>
   <li> Role: UX Designer </li>
   <li> Project Type: Work </li>
   <li> Tools: Lucidchart, Drupal, Salesforce </li>
 </ul>
 
 <!-- BACKGROUND -->
 <p> This came from another project involving refreshing the knowledge base articles on the UMass President's Office site. The current knowledge base site only has a search engine for users to look at specific articles/ sources. The team is looking to refresh and organize the web page. </p>
 
 <!-- PROCESS -->  
  <h2> PROCESS </h2>
 <section class="process">

  <h3> ORIGINAL STATE </h3>
  <p> The webpage includes a search bar and a list of published knowledge-base articles starting from the most recent. </p>
  
  <h3> PEER RESEARCH </h3>
  <p> I used knowledge base pages from other universities and support/help centers from other organizations.</p>

  <h3> CONTENT PLANNING </h3>
  <p> We received feedback from knowledge base article owners. They recommended preferences of what should be included on the webpage. Also what article information should include such as creation date, related articles, responsible department/team. 
  </p>

  <h3> IMPLEMENTATION </h3>
  <p> This will be the next step. </p>

    </div>

  <div class="wireframe-details">
    <ul>
      <li> The landing, category, and article pages are connected. On the landing page, I kept the search bar and added a directory of categories most of the articles might relate to. These are organized as containers/ cards which users can click on to go to the category pages. The right sidebar includes containers of the most recent and popular articles. The third bottom container includes a list of article tags.
        </li>
      <li> The category page includes groups of articles retaining to most frequently asked questions. On top of the section are buttons users can click to jump to a specific section. The right sidebar includes a search bar on the right side and the same containers as the landing page. The difference is it includes a list relating to the specific category.
        </li>
      <li> The article page continues the content. The details container includes the dates of when it was last modified and created. It also has a responsible team/department. I also added a list of related articles and links to sources outside of the knowledge base.
        </li>
