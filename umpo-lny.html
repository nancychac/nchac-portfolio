      <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p>
          The Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DIEA) 
          team hosted the first annual Lunar New Year Celebration at 
          the UMass President’s Office. I volunteered to be 
          the graphic deisgner in the planning commitee. 
          An event flyer educating attendees on the meaning and 
          traditions of the Lunar New Year was created. 
          I also helped put together the PowerPoint presentation 
          for the event speaker. The flyer was printed and displayed 
          digitally.

 <h2> PLANNING & DESIGN </h2>
    <p> I collaborated with the team to create an email invite for the event. 
      I used stock graphic images from Canva and Adobe for the flyer.
       Digital accessibility was an important factor to my design choices. 
       An example is the background and font colors. 
       I initially chose red as the primary color but decided to use navy blue
        from the university brand color palette for accessibility. 
        PowerPoint and InDesign were used to create the presentation 
        flyer for screen reading and alt text. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The first page of the flyer includes fireworks, lanterns, 
      and a family sitting together to represent traditions with the holiday.
       The second page introduces different dishes eaten from various 
       participating countries. I arrange the images to be like plates 
       on a dinner table. As well as including the native name and 
       English translation.

          <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
          <p>
            This was a side project in collaboration with the DIEA.
            I learned how to put event flyers together. 
            I had to plan out how to arrange a large amount of 
            information onto two pages. 
            Digital accessibility and branding were important as this flyer 
            was shared online. In my first rounds of designs, I learned that 
            I needed to be careful with colors, font, typography, and 
            graphics so the flyer can be accessible to as many readers as 
            possible. I also had to make it scale well to print and digital.
