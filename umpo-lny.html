 <!-- PROJECT INFO -->
 <h2> PROJECT INFO </h2>
 <ul>
   <li> Tools: Adobe InDesign, Photoshop, FreePik</li>
   <li> Role: Graphic Designer </li>
   <li> Project Type: Volunteer </li>
   <li> Timeline: February 2024 </li>
 </ul>
 
 <!-- BACKGROUND -->
  <h2> BACKGROUND </h2>
 <p> The Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DIEA) team hosted the first annual Lunar New Year Celebration at the UMass President's Office. I volunteered to design an event flyer educating attendees on the meaning and traditions of the Lunar New Year. This was printed and displayed digitally.    
</p>
 
 <!-- PROCESS -->
 <h2> OBJECTIVE </h2>
 <p> The event was not only to celebrate Lunar New Year, but to educate colleagues about the holiday. The flyer presents the significance and traditions from various countries that celebrate it.
</p>
 
 <h2> PLANNING & DESIGN </h2>
<ul> 
    <li> 
        I collaborated with the team to create an email invite for the event. I used Canva for the graphic images.
    </li>
    <li> 
        I also created a PowerPoint for the event speaker.
    </li>
    <li> 
        Digital accessibility was an important factor in my design choices. An example is the background and font colors. I initially chose red as the primary color but decided to use navy blue for accessibility and stick to the UMass branding. PowerPoint and InDesign were used to create the presentation flyer for screen reading and alt text. 
    </li>
</ul>

 <!-- OUTCOME -->
 <h2> OUTCOME </h2>
 <p> The event was a success. There was positve feedback on the logo and it demonstrated what the event is about. In the process, I had to create multiple iterations of the logo due to scalability issues when printing the merchandise. </p>

 <!-- TAKEAWAYS -->
 <h2> TAKEAWAYS </h2>
 <ul>
   <li> This was a side project in collaboration with the DIEA. I learned how to put event flyers together. I had to plan out how to arrange a large amount of information onto two pages.
</li>
<li> Digital accessibility and branding were important as this flyer was shared online. I avoided bright colors such as red to make my design accessibility friendly. This is also the reason why I chose navy blue as the background of the flyer.
</li>
 </ul>
