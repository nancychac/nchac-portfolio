    <section class="background">
      <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p>
          The UMass President's Office website presents information about the UMass System and is an information hub for employees.
          The Digital Experience (DX) and Communications teams oversee the organization's website. 
          It has not been updated for years so both teams are looking to refresh the website's design and 
          content so it further aligns with the university's initiatives. 
          DX is updating the website's layout to make it more user-friendly, accessible, and scalable for mobile. 
          Communications is updating the web content retaining the university. 
          They are updating the brand guide and document templates.
        </p>
    </section>
 
 <!-- PROCESS -->  
 <section class="process">
  <h2>PROJECT PROCESS</h2>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>ORIGNAL STATE</li>
    <p>
      The website is a resource for employees in HR, IT, and services used in the university. It is developed using Drupal.
      The main design issue was the header images taking up the majority of the pages when users visit. 
      Also, there are outdated images and information about the university. 
      The main objective for the refresh is to update the page templates and give them a modernized look while making them more accessible to users.
    </p>
    <li>PEER RESEARCH</li>
    <p>
      I looked into other universities (i.e., MIT, Princeton, and Yale) that have used Drupal for their websites. 
      I took notes on potential ideas we could take inspiration from and apply them to the President's Office site. 
      The UMass System website was another reference because the template resembled a modernized version of the President's Office.
      The following image is an idea board with all of my research notes:
    </p>    
    <img class="glightbox" src="wireframes/research-site-refresh.png" 
    alt="This is an idea board with design notes taken from the discovery meeting. 
    The notes are sectioned by resources and screenshots of noted elements from other university sites."
    width="100%">

    <li>CONTENT PLANNING & DESIGN</li>
    <p>
      Both teams discussed what should be updated on the website. 
      They are aiming to update the content on the homepage and brand guide with the addition of accessibility guidelines.
      The DX team is also aiming to improve the main navigation and visibility of the department directory. 
      I'm involved with both sides of the design process. 
      In Communications, I developed rough drafts of the brand guide and document templates. 
      In DX, I assisted in low and high-fidelity designs for the proposed updated site template.
    </p>
  </ol>

 <!-- CONTENT & DESIGN -->
 <section class="wireframe">
  <h2>WIREFRAME</h2>   
  <div class="wireframe-details">
    <ul>
      <li>
        These are the first round of desktop and mobile low-fidelity wireframes before creating the high-fidelity versions.
        These wireframes were created on Lucidchart from the Lucid Visual Collaboration Suite.
        One important change I made was adding a tab to the UMass System website at the top navigation.
        It is currently on the footer which is difficult for users to notice.
        I decided to add it to the top navigation so users can differentiate between the President's Office and the System sites.
    </li>
  </div> 
    <img class="wireframe-image glightbox"
      src="wireframes/site-refresh-wireframe.png" 
      alt="The wireframe includes designs for the landing pages of the UMass President's Office website. 
      These pages are Home, About, Organization, Reports & Initiatives, and Directory. 
      Notes besides were taken when the team reviewed the wireframe.">
   <img class="wireframe-image glightbox" 
   src="wireframes/mobile-site-hi-fi.png"
   alt="This is a mobile wireframe of the website. 
   The size reference used was iPhone 15 with a viewport of 393 pixels by 852 pixels." 
   >
   <div class="wireframe-details">
    <ul>
      <li>
        These are high-fidelity designs I collaborated with the DX intern using Lucidchart. 
        We assigned specific pages for ourselves to do and regrouped with the DX team for review.
        I designed the Home, Organization, and Directory pages. 
        This is the latest version of the proposed design.  
      </li>  
    </ul>
  </div> 

      <img class="wireframe-image glightbox"
      src="wireframes/2-site-hi-fi-pt1.png" 
      alt="These are the high fidelity designs of the home page in desktop. 
      This includes the top navigation, page header, message from the UMass president and profile picture, initiatives, press releases, recent news and reports, and footer.
      There are also notes on site links with blue underlines.
      It points to screenshots of MIT's website, noting that this was the reference.">

    "These are the high-fidelity designs of the organization and Directory pages. 
    On the organization page, the header image was removed. 
    There was an opening sentence added as a placeholder to introduce the page. 
    Under is the list of the departments in the President's Office. 
    Each name has a blue underline.
    The user can click on the names to go to the department pages.
    Under is a section for the list of related organizations and another for UMass System programs. 
    The directory page includes a search bar, and a list of departments with their phone numbers and emails.
    There's also a right navigation including the campus directory, related organizations, and the ethics and fraud hotline.">

    lightbox.on('open', (target) => {
        console.log('lightbox opened');
    });

      <h2>OUTCOME</h2>
      <p>
        This project is currently in the first phase which was removing the large header images from the product site.
        The next phase includes updating the brand guide and templates.

          <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
            <p>
            This project crosses over two teams I am working with in my fellowship. 
            It is a great opportunity for me to work on both sides of the project team. 
            I'm able to apply my marketing background to creating brand guides and templates. 
            There is also the opportunity to utilize the UX skills I've learned since working with DX.
            I also learned about creating high-fidelity and mobile wireframes. 
            In the next steps, I anticipate to futher work on the brand design with Communications. 
            Also, web content and user testing with the DX team.
