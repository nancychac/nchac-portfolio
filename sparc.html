    <!-- BACKGROUND-->
    <section class="background">
      <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p>
          Strategic Planning Analytics and Reporting for Campuses (SPARC) is a Tableau analytics tool created by UMass to 
          strategize and identify opportunities within the system. Areas of focus include enrollment, finance, and procurement. 
          The Administration and Finance department requested a logo to trademark SPARC. This is to brand it as a product of UMass. 
          I was responsible for creating the logo, dashboard banner, and web banner.
        </p>
    </section>

 <!-- PLANNING & DESIGN -->
 <section class="planning-design">
  <h2> PLANNING & DESIGN </h2>
     <p>
      I thought of what could symbolize SPARC while sticking to the UMass branding. 
      My idea was to have a link icon be the “s” in the name as SPARC links the whole university system together. 
      The blue is the UMass blue used on the branding. 
      The project stakeholders requested to have the full name included in the logo.
     </p>
     <p>
      The reason for the two versions was to scale to different media where the full name could and could not fit.
      The “s” link is considered to be the icon of the SPARC brand as shown in the dashboard banners.
     </p>

    <p>
      I also had to accommodate the logo on the web banner to avoid having too much text for digital accessibility.

<!--REFLECTION-->
 <section class="reflection">
    <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
      <p>
        This was my very first professional graphic design work. 
        I wanted the design to represent what SPARC is while retaining the UMass brand. 
        I also had to consider the scalability of the logo since this was shown digitally and as a sticker. 
        I also prepared various design  iterations and take the team’s design preferences into consideration. 
        Digital accessibility was a huge factor to consider while creating the web banner for the official webpage. 
        The original logo was inaccessible because there was too much text and the graphic image was placed behind the header title. 
        I had to create a separate web banner to accommodate the size and placement. 
        This was my introduction to graphic design and branding in a professional setting.
