 <!-- PROJECT INFO -->
 <h2> PROJECT INFO </h2>
 <ul>
   <li> Tools: Adobe Photoshop, Canva </li>
   <li> Role: Graphic Designer </li>
   <li> Project Type: Work Assignment </li>
   <li> Timeline: November to December 2023 </li>
 </ul>
 
 <!-- BACKGROUND -->
  <h2> BACKGROUND </h2>
 <p> Strategic Planning Analytics and Reporting for Campuses (SPARC) is a Tableau analytics tool created by UMass to strategize and identify opportunities within the system. Areas of focus include enrollment, finance, and procurement. The Administration and Finance department requested a logo to brand and trademark SPARC. I was responsible for creating the logo, dashboard banner, and web banner.     
</p>
 
 <!-- PROCESS -->
 <h2> PROCESS </h2>
 <h3> PURPOSE </h3>
 <p> The UMass President's Office Administration and Finance (A&F) department requested to have a logo to trademark SPARC as a product from UMass. 
</p>
 
 <h3> PLANNING </h3>
<ul> 
    <li> 
      I thought of what could symbolize SPARC while sticking to the UMass branding. My idea was to have a link icon be the “s” in the name as SPARC links the whole system together. The blue is the UMass blue used on the branding. The project stakeholders requested to have the full name included in the logo.
    </li>
    <li> 
      The reason for the two versions was to accommodate different media where the full name could and could not fit.
    </li>
    <li> 
      The “s” link is considered to be the icon of the SPARC brand as shown in the dashboard banners.
    </li>
    <li> 
      I also had to accommodate the logo on the web banner to avoid having too much text for digital accessibility.
    </li>
</ul>

 <!-- TAKEAWAYS -->
 <h2> TAKEAWAYS </h2>
 <ul>
  <li> This was my very first professional graphic design assignment. </li>
  <li> Planned the type of branding SPARC should be represented as while maintaining the UMass feel. Also had to consider the scalability of the logo since this was shown in multiple mediums. </li>
  <li> Had to prepare various iterations and take the team's design preferences into consideration. </li>
  <li> Digital accessibility was something to consider while creating the web banner for the official webpage. </li>
</ul>
